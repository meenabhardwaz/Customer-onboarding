# Customer-onboarding
Testing of a customer onboarding application

Tested 2 HTTP calls.
1. POST - Create
2. GET - Retrieve

Tested the positive scenarios for both the calls.

For Post call - Customer can create data with new id and can send all the details which are configurable.

For Get call - Customer can retrieve data of a particular user or can retrieve all the users data.
